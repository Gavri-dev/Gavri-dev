# Hey, I'm Gavri 👋

CS student focused on backend systems, full-stack development, and security research.

I like building tools that dig into how things actually work under the hood — WebSocket interception, reverse engineering, API design. Currently working in **Java**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**, with some **Python** on the side.

### 📌 Featured Project

**[kaBot](https://github.com/Gavri-dev/kaBot)** — AI-powered Chrome extension that auto-answers every Kahoot question type in real-time. Built with WebSocket interception, React DOM manipulation, and OpenAI API integration. Supports question types no other tool handles (pin-it, jumble, slider, open-ended).
